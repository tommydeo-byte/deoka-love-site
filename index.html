          Deoka my baby I just want to say thank you for being my lover for almost 3 years. Is been tough journey for both of us but we never
          gave up. It passed 2 valentines day that I have not showed any valentine love for you but this time I will not forget because I promised you that this time it 
          will be different. Please know that you mean the world to me when I sometime show that I do not. I would give you my whole lifespan if I could.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm so grateful for you, for us, and for all the tiny moments that add
          up to something so big and beautiful. So I wanted to freeze a few of
          those memories here.

                The day when I first saw you at work you caught me off gaurd because of how adorable you look. Really wanted to approach you way earlier but I was a little scared. Tried my luck by asking you how to do problem solve
                and things took off their.

                Since we started dating, overtime you shared me your bad moments and your best moments, even some gossip. I love every part of it even though it did not sound
                I was interested. Just listening to your voice makes me so calm and relaxed.

                My favorite memory of us walking around Atlanta, sitting and watching the cute view while we talk about us. 
                It may sound little but I can't stop thinking about that spot, whenever I see that spot I think about us.

                Even Though we had our worst moments as well I ignore them all, because it's part of the process of our love journey. 
                As long as we do not give up on each other and support each other, 
                I am more than happy to spend more than 100 years with you. I'm so glad I met
                you in a random moment. I cannot express much here but our day of Valentine I would do my best to show you how much 
                you meant to me.
